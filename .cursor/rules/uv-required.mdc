# Use uv for Python

**ALWAYS use `uv` for Python operations.** Never use `pip`, `python -m pip`, or raw `python`/`py` for package management.

- Add deps: `uv add PACKAGE` (or `uv add --group dev PACKAGE`)
- Run commands: `uv run COMMAND` (e.g. `uv run ruff check`, `uv run pytest`)
- Sync: `uv sync` (or `uv sync --group dev`)

## Shell parity (agents = user)

Your `~/.zshrc` defines the environment. Non-interactive terminals (IDE tasks, agent commands) do **not** source it by default, so agents get a different env than you.

**Fix:** This workspace uses `.vscode/settings.json` to force the terminal to run as **interactive** (`zsh -i`), so `~/.zshrc` is always sourced. Agents experience the same environment as you.
